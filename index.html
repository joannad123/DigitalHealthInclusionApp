<h1> Digital Health Inclusion App</h1>

<h2>
    This app will help you improve your digital skills<br>
    and educate you about digital health.
</h2>

<p>
    You will first be asked to register/login to begin using the app.<br>
    (Don't worry, there will be a tutorial available to show you how to do this!)<br>
    You will then be asked a few questions so the app is usable based on your skills.<br>
    These questions will result in you being given a score which decides whether you have<br>
    unlocked the basic version of the app or the advanced version.<br>
